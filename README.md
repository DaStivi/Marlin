## Using this repo.

Each branch with a name related to the B1 contains the source code for that branch and a compiled binary file in the root folder.

If you want to go the easy route just copy the bin file onto your SD card in the motherboard (not TFT) and reboot. Once it is done you should have a FIRMWARE.CUR fie on the SD. That menas it worked.

If you'd like to make futher tewaks to the configs then you are more than welcome to submit issues or pull requests.

Hopefully we will be able to grow this repo to include configs and builds for a variety of common implementations of the B1 which will save people a lot of frustration.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the us
